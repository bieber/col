compose:
* Function composition.  Feeds its input to the last function in its argument
* list, then feeds that function's output to the second-to-last, and so on,
* eventually returning the output of the last function in the list as the 
* combined function's output.

construct:
* Sequence construction.  Feeds its input to each of its argument functions,
* and generate a sequence where each element is the output of one of the 
* argument functions.
